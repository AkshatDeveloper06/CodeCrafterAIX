# Blockly Extension Builder for MIT App Inventor

A visual and dynamic interface that uses Blockly to create MIT App Inventor extensions. This project aims to make extension building intuitive by providing an interface to configure, design, and export extension code without extensive programming experience.

## Features

- **Blockly Integration**: Drag-and-drop functionality to create extension components.
- **Text, Math, and Control Blocks**: Implemented multiple customizable blocks for common extension features.
- **Custom Block Creation**: Easily create, manage, and organize blocks like properties, methods, and imports.
- **Exportable Code**: Generate Java code directly from the blocks for use in MIT App Inventor.
- **Themed UI**: Choose from different themes for a personalized workspace.
- **Multilingual Support**: Use English as the default, with more translations planned.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Java.
- An understanding of MIT App Inventor components.
